My personal website and portfolio. The featured animation is a demonstration of plant rendering
techniques using [Lindenmayer Systems](http://algorithmicbotany.org/papers/#abop) that I created using [p5.js](https://p5js.org/).

Two hobby papers I wrote (1 in collaboration) are included in the static/papers folder of this repository. One is on the development of a compiler and bytecode interpreter for a hobby language a friend and I created called [Slang](https://github.com/ethan2-0/Slang). The other is research done on pathfinding algorithms that I wrote myself.
